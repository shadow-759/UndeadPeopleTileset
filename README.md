## Downloading
### Releases
This is the preferred option, just head to the right side and select the latest release. If you are using mods, make sure to download the correct zip file in the Assets list.<br>

### Repository Download
If there isn't a current enough release you can download the repository using this button. Note that this also contains legacy files, the data you need is found in the TILESETS directory within the downloaded zip file.<br>

## Installing
Select the ```gfx``` (and ```data``` if you are using mods) folder and copy/drag them into the game files, where there are the same folder names and accept any overwrites. For reference, your ```gfx``` folder should look roughly like this now:<br>

There may also be ```MshockXotto+REAL``` and ```MSX++UnDeadPeopleEditionLegacy``` folders, these are mostly for mod compatibility and you can delete them if they are not needed.

**If you are using the Catapult Launcher** you may want to copy into the ```userdata/gfx``` folder instead. This way your UndeadPeople tileset doesn't get removed when updating to another experimental game release.
